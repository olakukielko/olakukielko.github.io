  <h2>Week 1</h2>
  <p>In the first three weeks, I was to prepare myself for the material.  In the first week, I read the following research papers:
  <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf">Mesos</a>, <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41684.html">Omega</a>
   and <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html">Borg</a>.  All three of the papers pertain to methods of optimizing cluster systems between real life frameworks.
 I was a little bit familiar with the concept from taking CS450, however, these papers obviously went into much more detail than what I was familiar with. I went over these papers several times,
taking detailed notes to make sure I understand as much as I can from these. For now, I have no quesitons about these concepts; I am sure some will pop up with practice. However, for now I trust
the authors to know what they are talking about. I also met with professor Zhiling Lan and discussed my plans and actions for the next three weeks.</p>
  <h2>Week 2</h2>
  <p>As the first week came to a close, I made sure that I understood the three cluster/scheduler concepts. I finished up my notes and self study.  These research papers were taking a long time to comprehend, especially
  with such elaborate language.  The next step I made was to read the following <a href="http://umbrant.com/blog/2015/mesos_omega_borg_survey.html">blog</a>, which summarized the papers really well. I have also downloaded the <a href="https://github.com/google/cluster-scheduler-simulator">cluster scheduler simulator</a> and the <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-sls/SchedulerLoadSimulator.html">Hadoop simulator</a>. I actually have some <b>trouble</b> with the cluster simulator.  After some time and installing packages,
  I was able to install everything correctly without any errors.  However, when I run the command given "bin/sbt run" I get the following error: <p>
  <img src="image1.png"><br> I have no idea what to do at this point.I figured it has to do with the Java version(8 instead of 7), however, I can't figure out how to downgrade properly. I do have some hours left to work this weekend, and I will use the remainder of my time this week to trouble shoot this.<br>
