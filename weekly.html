  <h2>Week 1</h2>
  <p>In the first three weeks, I was to prepare myself for the material.  In the first week, I read the following research papers:
  <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf">Mesos</a>, <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41684.html">Omega</a>
   and <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html">Borg</a>.  All three of the papers pertain to methods of optimizing cluster systems between real life frameworks.
 I was a little bit familiar with the concept from taking CS450, however, these papers obviously went into much more detail than what I was familiar with. I went over these papers several times,
taking detailed notes to make sure I understand as much as I can from these. For now, I have no quesitons about these concepts; I am sure some will pop up with practice. However, for now I trust
the authors to know what they are talking about. I also met with professor Zhiling Lan and discussed my plans and actions for the next three weeks.</p>
  <h2>Week 2</h2>
  <p>As the first week came to a close, I made sure that I understood the three cluster/scheduler concepts. I finished up my notes and self study.  These research papers were taking a long time to comprehend, especially
  with such elaborate language.  The next step I made was to read the following <a href="http://umbrant.com/blog/2015/mesos_omega_borg_survey.html">blog</a>, which summarized the papers really well. I have also downloaded the <a href="https://github.com/google/cluster-scheduler-simulator">cluster scheduler simulator</a> and the <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-sls/SchedulerLoadSimulator.html">Hadoop simulator</a>. I actually have some <b>trouble</b> with the cluster simulator.  After some time and installing packages,
  I was able to install everything correctly without any errors.  However, when I run the command given "bin/sbt run" I get the following error: <p>
  <img src="image1.png"><br> I have no idea what to do at this point.I figured it has to do with the Java version(8 instead of 7), however, I can't figure out how to downgrade properly. I do have some hours left to work this weekend, and I will use the remainder of my time this week to trouble shoot this.<br>

</p>
  <h2>Week 3</h2>
  <p>Incorporating the Google trace logs into the simulator:<br> It seems that I've come into another roadblock. In order to download the trace files, the instructional
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5g07T_gRDg9Z0lsSTEtTWtpOW8/view">pdf</a> says to install GSUtil software.  It links it there, and I believe I followed the correct instructions,
however, upon trying to execute any GSUtil command such as the one given <br> <img src="image2.png"><br>I get a message that gsutil is not installed: <img src="image3.png"><br>There's not a lot of help online but I will continue trying to find a solution.</p>
Update: I did post to the forum of the simulators and it's been about 7 days, and I have not gotten a response from the author, unfortunately.  I have also asked a CS graduate student for help. I asked him if he could try instaling it himself.  He came up with the exact same problem as
I and suggested that I try running it on a virtual machine.  Therefore, I'm currently installing ubuntu as a dual boot on my computer to see if I'll be able to execute this on Linux</i></div>
  <h2>Week 4</h2>
  After almost as many attempts on the Google Cluster Simulator, I have successfully installed Hadoop following these <a href="http://codesfusion.blogspot.in/2013/10/setup-hadoop-2x-220-on-ubuntu.html"> instructions</a>.  I have version 2.7.2 running on the latest version of Ubuntu.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get it to run on Mac, but this will suffice.
  However, I am happy that I was able to get it running! I haven't done much with it but for now, from starting it, I'm getting this output: <br>
  <br>hduser1@olakuk:~$ jps
<br>11088 sun.tools.jps.Jps
<br>6433 ResourceManager
<br>5941 NameNode
<br>6087 DataNode
<br>6271 SecondaryNameNode
<br>6735 NodeManager
<br>, which, according to the guide, means the program is working properly.  I look forward to working on it more today.
